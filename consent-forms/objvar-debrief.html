          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Background.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;People can estimate statistical properties (e.g., average, variability) from a visual scene, especially when several objects of the same category appear together (e.g., trees in a forest). Studies found that this ability (ensemble judgments) work with different objects and different visual features (e.g., sizes of circles, orientations of lines; Chong & Treisman, 2003; Kacin et al., 2021). People can also make ensemble judgments about complex object features such as the average valence of facial expressions (Haberman & Whitney, 2007). However, it is unclear whether ensemble judgments for complex object features are made at the feature level or object level (i.e., whether average nose and average eyes are used to form an average face, or faces are the units of average judgments). Since objects contain a collection of visual features, understanding complex object ensemble judgments requires understanding of the level at which the visual system estimates the average of features/objects.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The present study will investigate how the relationship among object features influence ensemble judgments about complex objects. Differences between ensemble judgments for objects with correlated features (e.g., longer lines correlated with more clockwise orientations) and objects with random features, would support the idea that ensemble judgments are made at the object level, where the relationship among features matter.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Purpose.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In this study, we intend to understand whether the relationship among object features influence ensemble judgments.</p>
